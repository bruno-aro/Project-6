    "# API\n",
    "\n",
    "**API** stands for **Application Programming Interface**, which is a \"mechanism that enables two software components to communicate with each other using a set of **definitions** and **protocols**\". This really refers to any two pieces of software that are communicating. What does that mean for us, though? We will mostly look at using **web APIs** where Software Component One contains data, Software Component Two (our project) wants that data. We will make **requests** through the API for some of that data and, so long as we follow the \"rules\", the data we receive can then be used in our project.\n",
    "\n",
    "![api anatomy](https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1a8hvK3-m1CrBMjVlINYo2I_q5QY2mI73&sz=s4000)\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of an API like the middleman between a database and a frontend/client application. For security reasons, you will never allow a client direct access to your database. If you are using an SQL database, you would write an API which defines the queries that are to be allowed, by whom they can be made, and each query will usually be linked to what is called an **endpoint**. An **endpoint** is a URL - a path to the function that triggers the query and then returns the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "![api anatomy](https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1i2CRK_YkDOTyG44eCOch2LMDAa5_1YOo&sz=s4000)\n",
    "\n",
    "Most web APIs will be **REST** APIs - this stands for **Representational State Transfer**. There are many request types: **GET**, **POST**, **DELETE**, etc., and each endpoint will also be linked to a request type. For this project, you will only be using GET - as in, we will be \"getting\" (ie. reading) some data from the API. The other request types will be linked to endpoints that manipulate the data in the database - creating, updating, or deleting. Additional authorization is usually required to perform these requests. \n",
    "\n",
    "Every API is built differently. This is because they are usually built for a specific purpose or platform. You will need to thoroughly read through the **documentation** for whichever API you choose to work with. This will explain which **endpoints** are available, how to customize your requests, and how to use an **API token/key** (if required). Some APIs are stricter with their data than others. \n",
    "\n",
    "An API token or key is an authorization strategy used by many API services to control access. If it is required, you will need to create an account to generate a key, and that key will be sent together with every request you make, giving the platform information about how you are using their service. Sometimes there will be different tiers - a free key, and paid options that will allow more requests, or access to endpoints with additional information or functionality. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Make a Request\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's have a look at a few API examples! \n",
    "\n",
    "[Countries](https://restcountries.com/)  \n",
    "[Weather](https://www.weatherapi.com/docs/)  \n",
    "[Images](https://pixabay.com/api/docs/)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Web Browser\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use a web browser to make a GET request (so long as no headers are required) - simply put the endpoint into the URL bar. You'll see that you won't be directed to a front-end webpage, you'll just be served JSON data. You can install an extension such as [JSON Viewer](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/json-viewer/gbmdgpbipfallnflgajpaliibnhdgobh) to \"prettify\" the view. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Postman\n",
    "\n",
    "A convenient tool for API testing is [Postman](https://www.postman.com/). The UI can be helpful to construct longer queries, and you can also append headers, cookies, or a body to the request if they are required. On the right, the `</>` symbol will open a menu that provides code snippets of the request, when you are satisfied with your request, you can use this to help you implement it into Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Requests (Python Library)\n",
    "\n",
    "A very convenient library for making HTTP requests using Python is [**requests**](https://pypi.org/project/requests/) (\"Requests is an elegant and simple http library for python, built with ðŸ’š.) Use Anaconda to apply it to your Python Environment for this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make a request, simply call the `requests` function, specify the request type, then give it the endpoint you wish to access:"
